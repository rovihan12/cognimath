In a right-angled triangle, we use three primary trigonometric ratios.\n\n### SOH-CAH-TOA\nThis is a mnemonic to remember the definitions of the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for an acute angle $\\theta$ in a right triangle.\n\n- **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse\n  $$ \\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{Opposite}}{\\text{Hypotenuse}} $$\n\n- **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse\n  $$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{Adjacent}}{\\text{Hypotenuse}} $$\n\n- **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent\n  $$ \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{Opposite}}{\\text{Adjacent}} $$\n\nThe **hypotenuse** is the side opposite the right angle.

It is used to extend the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent to all angles, not just those in a right triangle.\n\nFor any point $(x, y)$ on the unit circle, the angle $\\theta$ is formed by the positive x-axis and the radius to that point. We can define the trigonometric functions based on the coordinates of this point:\n\n- $ \\cos(\\theta) = x $\n- $ \\sin(\\theta) = y $\n\n### Radian Measure\n**Radians** are an alternative unit for measuring angles. One radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.\n\n- To convert degrees to radians: $ \\text{radians} = \\text{degrees} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ} $\n- To convert radians to degrees: $ \\text{degrees} = \\text{radians} \\cdot \\frac{180^\\circ}{\\pi} $\n\nKey equivalences:\n- $ 360^\\circ = 2\\pi $ radians\n- $ 180^\\circ = \\pi $ radians\n- $ 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ radians"

      "teks": "### Law of Sines\nThe Law of Sines is used to solve for unknown sides or angles in **any** triangle (not just right triangles). The law states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant.\n\n$$ \\frac{a}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(B)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(C)} $$\n\n### Law of Cosines\nThe Law of Cosines is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. It relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. It is used when you know two sides and the included angle (SAS) or all three sides (SSS).\n\n$$ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(C) $$\n\nSimilar formulas can be written for $a^2$ and $b^2$."
