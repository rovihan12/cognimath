      "teks": "Coordinate geometry is a branch of mathematics that uses a coordinate system to study geometry. The most common system is the Cartesian plane, which consists of two perpendicular axes, the x-axis and the y-axis.\n\n### Slope of a Line\n**Slope** is a measure of the steepness of a line. It is the ratio of the change in y-coordinate (rise) to the change in x-coordinate (run) between two points on the line. The formula for the slope ($m$) of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is:\n\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$\n\n- A positive slope means the line goes up from left to right.\n- A negative slope means the line goes down from left to right.\n- A slope of zero ($m = 0$) is a horizontal line.\n- An undefined slope is a vertical line.\n\n### Parallel and Perpendicular Lines\n- **Parallel lines** have the same slope. If line 1 has slope $m_1$ and line 2 has slope $m_2$, they are parallel if $m_1 = m_2$.\n- **Perpendicular lines** have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other. They are perpendicular if $m_1 \\cdot m_2 = -1$ (or $m_2 = -\\frac{1}{m_1}$).",

For a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the midpoint $(x_m, y_m)$ is:\n\n$$(x_m, y_m) = (\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})$$\n\n### Distance Formula\nThe **distance** between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The formula for the distance ($d$) is:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$"
