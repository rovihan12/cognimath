      "text": "Logic and set theory form the foundation of modern mathematics and computer science. Logic provides the rules for valid reasoning and argumentation, while set theory deals with collections of objects and their relationships.\n\n### Importance in Mathematics\n- Logic ensures mathematical proofs are valid and sound\n- Set theory provides a common language for defining mathematical objects\n- Both are essential for computer science, particularly in algorithms and database theory\n- They form the basis for probability theory and statistics\n\n### Historical Context\nLogic has been studied since ancient times (Aristotle), while modern set theory was developed by Georg Cantor in the late 19th century. These fields continue to evolve and find new applications in artificial intelligence and formal verification."
