If:\n$a = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$\n$b = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} \\cdots p_k^{b_k}$\nThen:\nGCD$(a, b) = p_1^{\\min(a_1,b_1)} p_2^{\\min(a_2,b_2)} \\cdots p_k^{\\min(a_k,b_k)}$\nLCM$(a, b) = p_1^{\\max(a_1,b_1)} p_2^{\\max(a_2,b_2)} \\cdots p_k^{\\max(a_k,b_k)}$\nAnd since $\\min(a_i, b_i) + \\max(a_i, b_i) = a_i + b_i$, we get the relationship.\n\n### Applications\nThis relationship allows us to:\n- Find LCM if we know GCD and vice versa\n- Verify calculations of GCD and LCM\n- Solve problems more efficiently\n\nExample: If GCD(12, 18) = 6, then LCM(12, 18) = $\\frac{12 \\times 18}{6}$ = 36"
