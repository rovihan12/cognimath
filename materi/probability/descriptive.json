Mean (Average)\n$$ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$\n- The sum of all values divided by the number of values\n- Sensitive to extreme values (outliers)\n- Most commonly used measure of center\n\n### 2. Median\n- The middle value when data is ordered from smallest to largest\n- For odd number of values: the exact middle value\n- For even number of values: average of the two middle values\n- Not affected by extreme values\n\n### 3. Mode\n- The value that appears most frequently in a dataset\n- A dataset can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes\n- Useful for categorical data\n\n**Example**: Data: 12, 15, 18, 22, 22, 25, 28\n- Mean: (12+15+18+22+22+25+28)/7 = 20.29\n- Median: 22 (the middle value)\n- Mode: 22 (appears twice)"

Standard Deviation\n$$ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\mu)^2}{n}} \\quad \\text{(population)} $$\n$$ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}} \\quad \\text{(sample)} $$\n- Measures how far data points are from the mean\n- Larger standard deviation = more spread out data\n- Smaller standard deviation = data clustered around mean\n\n**Calculation steps**:\n1. Calculate the mean\n2. Subtract mean from each value\n3. Square each difference\n4. Sum all squared differences\n5. Divide by n (population) or n-1 (sample)\n6. Take the square root\n\n**Example**: Data: 4, 7, 9, 10, 15 (sample)\n- Mean = 9\n- Differences: -5, -2, 0, 1, 6\n- Squared differences: 25, 4, 0, 1, 36\n- Sum = 66\n- Variance = 66/4 = 16.5\n- Standard deviation = √16.5 ≈ 4.06"
