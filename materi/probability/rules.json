      "teks": "Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of events occurring. It provides a mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty and making predictions about random phenomena.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Experiment**: A process that produces outcomes (e.g., rolling a die)\n- **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes (e.g., {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})\n- **Event**: A subset of the sample space (e.g., rolling an even number: {2, 4, 6})\n- **Probability**: A number between 0 and 1 that measures the likelihood of an event\n\nProbability is used in statistics, science, engineering, economics, gaming, and everyday decision making."
